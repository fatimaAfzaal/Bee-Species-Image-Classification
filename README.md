# Bee Species Image Classification

## Project Description

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images is a fascinating and challenging problem. This project focuses on using the Python image library Pillow to load and manipulate image data, perform common image transformations, and build them into a data processing pipeline.

### Project Highlights

- Use Pillow (PIL), a popular Python image processing library, to work with image data.
- Load and preprocess images for machine learning tasks.
- Implement common image transformations such as cropping, resizing, and grayscale conversion.
- Build an image data pipeline for classification tasks.
- Lay the foundation for more advanced image classification and deep learning projects.
